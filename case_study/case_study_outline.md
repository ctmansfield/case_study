# Case Study — Outline (Draft)

## 1. Introduction
- Baseline health, key exposures, and overview of episodic physiology (hyperadrenergic + histamine-mediated flares).

## 2. Clinical Course & Timeline
- Anchor events and chronology referencing `docs/timeline.md` (5–10 high-signal datapoints).

## 3. Phenotype Description (Condensed HPI)
- Onset & evolution, typical episode sequence (prodrome → peak → recovery), frequency/duration/severity, triggers (stress, histamine, folate), alleviators (clonidine, H1/H2/DAO, breathing, exercise pacing).

## 4. Objective Data
- Point to CSV sources in `data/tracking/` (BP/HR, glucose variability, medication-response, sleep) and `data/analytics/`.

## 5. Genetics & Mechanistic Map
- Summarize `data/analytics/genetics_top_hits.md` and `data/analytics/genetics_appendix.md`; tie to `docs/mechanistic_map.md` and `docs/mechanisms*.md`.

## 6. Interventions & Responses
- Medication effects (beneficials vs adverse), dosing windows, response patterns.

## 7. Differential Diagnoses (Working List)
- MCAS physiology; adrenergic hyperresponsiveness; stress-induced hyperglycemia; impaired estrogen clearance; medication intolerance physiology.

## 8. Discussion (Reserved for clinician/author team)
- Implications, limitations, hypotheses, and prospective evaluation plan.
