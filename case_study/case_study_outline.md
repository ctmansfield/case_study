# Case Study Outline (Skeleton)

1. **Introduction**
   - Baseline health status.
   - Overview of episodic physiology (adrenergic, histamine/MCAS, metabolic).

2. **Clinical Course & Timeline**
   - Anchor 5–10 key events (onset, major flares, treatment pivots, notable lab findings).
   - Cross-ref: `docs/timeline.md`, timeline figures.

3. **Phenotype Description**
   - Condensed HPI: triggers (stress, histamine, folate), multi-system flares, metabolic/neurologic/autonomic pattern.
   - Cross-ref: `docs/symptom_log.md`, `docs/physician_brief.md`.

4. **Objective Data**
   - Vitals: `data/tracking/bp_hr.csv` + analytics.
   - Glucose: `data/tracking/glucose.csv` + analytics.
   - Sleep: `data/tracking/sleep.csv` + analytics.
   - Medication responses: `data/tracking/med_response.csv`.

5. **Genetics & Mechanistic Map**
   - Core variants and functional effects.
   - Cross-refs: `data/analytics/genetics_appendix.md`, `docs/genotype_phenotype_map.md`, `docs/mechanistic_map.md`, `docs/mechanisms_neuroimmune.md`.

6. **Interventions & Responses**
   - Medications and supplements: benefit vs adverse.
   - Cross-ref: `docs/medication_effects.md`, `data/analytics/med_response_summary.md`.

7. **Differential Considerations**
   - MCAS / histamine-driven physiology.
   - Adrenergic/autonomic dysregulation.
   - Endocrine clearance pattern (E2, T, SHBG) with genotype.
   - Stress-induced hyperglycemia / metabolic inflexibility.
   - Medication intolerance physiology.

8. **Neurodevelopmental Context (ASD)**
   - Formal diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
   - Relevance to autonomic regulation, sensory reactivity, interoception, and medication sensitivity.
   - How ASD context informs interpretation of the above differentials.

9. **Discussion**
   - Reserved for clinician author(s) to synthesize findings and place in the literature context.
