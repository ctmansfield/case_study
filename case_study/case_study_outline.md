## Title
Prolonged-fasting hyperglycemia with delayed ketogenesis in a non-diabetic adult: evidence of central nutrient-sensing/HPA dysregulation with mitochondrial inflexibility

## Abstract (structured)
[To be completed after Results/Discussion]

## Case Presentation
- Demographics (de-identified), PMH, medications (TRT, anastrozole, HCG), metformin trial, GLP-1/GIP history.
- Symptom clusters: 5–6am lows, exercise HR cap, brain fog during fast, refeed migraine, abdominal pain.

## Investigations
- Longitudinal labs (CBC macrocytosis; LFT spikes; lipids; thyroid; DHEAS/cortisol).
- Fasting series table (glucose, insulin, C-pep, proinsulin, β-HB; timestamps).
- CGM figure; expected vs observed physiology figure.
- Note quetiapine temporal link to ketone rise.

## Differential Diagnosis
- Insulinoma (unlikely), classic IR (inconsistent), adrenal partial insufficiency vs rigidity, GH axis dysregulation, mitochondrial substrate-switching defect, autonomic/MCAS contribution.

## Treatment & Response
- Prior tirzepatide (partial compensation), ipamorelin/CJC (improved tolerance), non-pharmacologic (circadian, Zone-2).

## Outcome & Follow-up
- Late ketosis at ~72h; plan confirmatory testing.

## Discussion
- Central thesis and mechanism with references.

## Patient Perspective
[2–4 sentences]

## Consent & Ethics
- Patient-authored; de-identified; consent documented.
