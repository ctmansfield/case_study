# Case Study Outline

## 1. Introduction
Brief baseline physiology and symptom history.

## 2. Clinical Course & Timeline
Include:
- Onset markers  
- Significant flares  
- Seroquel → ketosis transition note  
- Patterns over time  

## 3. Phenotype Description
Condensed HPI with major clusters:
- Autonomic  
- Mast-cell–mediator  
- Metabolic  
- Sleep  
- Stress response  

## 4. Objective Data Summary
Reference CSVs in `data/tracking/`.

## 5. Genetics & Mechanistic Interpretation
Variants → pathways → phenotypes.

## 6. Interventions & Responses
Medication table and reproducible effects.

## 7. Differential Diagnosis Framework
- MCAS  
- Autonomic dysregulation  
- Stress hyperglycemia  
- Estrogen-clearance physiology  
- Medication intolerance pattern  

## 8. Discussion (to be completed by clinician)
