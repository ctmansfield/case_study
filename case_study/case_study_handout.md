## Diagnostic Alignment (Clinician-Facing)

### A) Mast Cell–Mediated Symptom Complex (MCAS-like physiology)
- Recurrent **multi-system** episodes: neurologic (cognitive slowing), cardiovascular (BP variability), metabolic (fasting BG↑), sleep fragmentation.
- **Dietary histamine** and **folate overload** reproducibly trigger identical symptom clusters.
- **Responsive** to H1/H2 blockade and DAO supplementation.
- Normal tryptase **does not exclude** MCAS; diagnosis is primarily pattern-driven.

### B) Adrenergic Dysregulation / Autonomic Surges
- Paroxysmal **hypertension**, tremor, hyperarousal, internal “electrical noise.”
- **Clonidine** reliably aborts episodes (↓ central norepinephrine).
- Fits hyperadrenergic-autonomic physiology.

### C) Estrogen-Handling Genotype With Clinical Expression
Functional variants:
- **CYP3A4*22**, **CYP3A5*3** → reduced estrogen clearance  
- **UGT1A1*28 tag** → low glucuronidation  
- **COMT Val158Met (Met)** → slow catecholamine and catechol-estrogen methylation  

Together these create heightened reactivity to hormonal fluctuations and stress signaling.

### D) Stress-Linked Metabolic Instability
- Stress → cortisol → **fasting glucose elevation**
- Headaches occur reliably when BG drops back **below 110 mg/dL**
- Correlates with adrenergic load + impaired metabolic buffering.

## Genotype → Phenotype (Functional Summary)

| Variant | Functional Effect | Phenotype Expression |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| COMT Val158Met (Met) | ↓ COMT methylation | Slow catecholamine/estrogen clearance → hyperarousal |
| CYP3A4*22 | ↓ CYP3A4 activity | Slow E2 clearance |
| CYP3A5*3 | Non-expressor | Increased reliance on CYP3A4 |
| UGT1A1*28 tag | ↓ Glucuronidation | Slow testosterone/E2 metabolite clearance |
| SULT1E1 promoter | ↓ Sulfation | Longer estradiol half-life |
| SHBG rs6259 | ↑ SHBG | Lower free T/E2 → sensitivity to small hormonal shifts |
| CYP19A1 regulatory cluster | Aromatase modulation | Variability in estrogen production |

The following datasets are included for clinician review:

- `data/tracking/bp_hr.csv`  
- `data/tracking/glucose.csv`  
- `data/tracking/med_response.csv`
