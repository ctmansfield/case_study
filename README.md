# 🧠 Personal Medical Case Study (Private Repository)

This repository contains a **structured, de-identified medical case study** designed to help clinicians, specialists, and collaborators understand the full scope of my symptoms, history, and clinical course.

It is intended as a living record built in collaboration with ChatGPT (GPT-5), organized across multiple working sessions with explicit structure and traceability.

## 🩺 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Maintain a **chronological and system-based record** of symptoms and events.  
- Provide doctors with a **complete, coherent overview** of my history and adverse drug reactions.  
- Ensure **nothing important is omitted** by following a guided, multi-session workflow.
