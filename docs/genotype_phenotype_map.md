# Genotype → Phenotype Map

This table links each functional variant to expected biochemical changes and observed clinical patterns.

| Gene | Variant | Effect | Mechanistic Interpretation | Phenotype Expression |
|------|---------|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| COMT | Val158Met (Met) | ↓ COMT activity | Reduced methylation of catecholamines + catechol estrogens | Hyperarousal, slow recovery after stress |
| CYP3A4 | *22 | ↓ CYP3A4 | Reduced Phase I clearance of estradiol | Sensitivity to hormonal shifts; E2-dependent symptoms |
| CYP3A5 | *3 | Non-expressor | Loss of CYP3A5 pathway | Burden shifted to CYP3A4; amplified effect of *22 |
| UGT1A1 | *28 tag | ↓ glucuronidation | Reduced Phase II clearance | Slower removal of E2/T metabolites |
| SULT1E1 | promoter variant | ↓ sulfation | Limited estrogen sulfonation | Higher bioactive estradiol half-life |
| SHBG | rs6259 | ↑ SHBG | Higher binding affinity | Lower free T/E2 → more sensitivity |
| CYP19A1 | rs4646/rs10046/cluster | Regulatory | Alters aromatase expression | Variability in estrogen production |
