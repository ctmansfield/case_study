# Genotype → Phenotype Map

| Variant | Functional Effect | Phenotype Expression |
|---|---|---|
| **COMT rs4680 (Val158Met)** | ↓ COMT activity → slower catechol/estrogen methylation | Hyperarousal, anxiety sensitivity; E2 intolerance when methyl load high |
| **CYP3A4 rs35599367 (*22)** | ↓ CYP3A4 expression | Slower hepatic E2 clearance; higher sensitivity to dose changes |
| **CYP3A5 rs776746 (*3)** | Non-expressor | Shifts clearance burden to CYP3A4; accentuates *22 |
| **UGT1A1 rs887829 (*28 tag)** | ↓ Glucuronidation | Impaired E2 metabolite clearance; bilirubin drift |
| **SULT1E1 promoter var** | ↓ Sulfation | Prolonged active estradiol half-life |
| **CYP1A2 rs762551 (*1F)** | Inducible, faster 2-hydroxylation (if induced) | Protective route if induced; reduced if liver load high / low methyl donors |
| **SHBG ↑ alleles** | ↑ SHBG | Lowers free T/E2 → symptom swing sensitivity |

## Neurodevelopmental Integration (ASD)

The patient’s formal ASD diagnosis interacts with several genotype-driven pathways:

| Factor | Physiologic Relevance | Integration with ASD |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| COMT Val158Met (Met) | Slower catecholamine methylation; prolonged adrenaline/noradrenaline signaling | ASD is associated with heightened sympathetic reactivity; reduced catecholamine clearance can amplify this. |
| HPA Reactivity | Cortisol → glucose elevation during stress | Autistic adults frequently exhibit higher baseline cortisol and slower down-regulation of HPA activation. |
| Medication Sensitivity | Nonlinear or paradoxical effects from CNS-active medications | Pharmacodynamic variability is common in ASD and helps contextualize documented drug responses. |
| Autonomic Inertia | Delayed sympathetic downshift after stress events | Consistent with ASD-related reductions in autonomic flexibility and vagal tone. |

This integration strengthens the mechanistic basis for the patient's stress-linked metabolic and autonomic phenotype.
