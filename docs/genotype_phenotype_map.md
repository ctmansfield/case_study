# Genotype → Phenotype Map (Candidate variants)

| Variant | Functional effect | Expected phenotype | Observed pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMT Val158Met (rs4680) | ↓ catechol methylation | Slower NE/Epi & catechol estrogen clearance | Hyperarousal, stress sensitivity |
| UGT1A1*28 | ↓ glucuronidation | Slower estrogen metabolite clearance | E2 symptom spikes |
| CYP3A4*22 | ↓ CYP3A4 activity | Slower steroid/drug clearance | Sensitivity to E2 & meds |
| SOD2 V16A | Altered mitochondrial ROS defense | Oxidative stress with exertion/fasting | Fatigue, poor switching |
| DAO/HNMT variants | ↓ histamine catabolism | MCAS-like flares | Food-triggered episodes |

*Note:* Final variant list should be verified against your raw genotype file.
