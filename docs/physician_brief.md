### Revised HPI Summary
Episodes often **go unrecognized until they have already passed**, retrospectively marked by a mix of **wild blood-glucose spikes**, **migraine**, **lost sleep**, **agitation**, **hyperarousal**, **hypertension**, **post-operative foot swelling**, **mood swings**, **exhaustion/lethargy**, **light sensitivity**, **heightened smell**, **blunted senses**, **subjective cognitive “shutdown”**, **disconnection from surroundings**, **memory loss**, **loss of coordination**, **falls**, and **presyncope**.  
Frequency tracks with **stress or adrenergic activation**, whether from acute surges or antagonistic social/physiologic triggers.  Duration scales with how long symptoms reinforce one another — sometimes **weeks to months**, and historically **years** on poorly-tolerated medications.  Severity **progressively worsens** with each flare, without full recovery of baseline cognition.

### Alleviators
**Clonidine**, proactive **H1/H2 blockade** (hydroxyzine + famotidine + DAO), **box breathing**, **light exercise**, **sauna/hot-tub use**, **strength training**, and **maintaining flat blood glucose** all blunt the cascade.

### Day-after Effects
Dependent on episode duration and feedback severity — typically **fatigue**, **lethargy**, **brain-fog**, and **metabolic drift** with residual autonomic lability.
# Physician Brief

## Summary (HPI in brief)
Patient with stress-triggered episodes characterized by loss of cognitive function and memory lapses, physical uncoordination with increased injury risk, severe uncontrollable anxiety/irritability, transient blood pressure spikes, non-restorative sleep, and intermittently elevated fasting blood glucose. Episodes follow stress exposure and resolve variably, leaving next-day fatigue/fog (details below once quantified).

## Problem List
1) Stress-induced neurocognitive dysfunction (episodic cognitive shutdown, memory lapses)  
2) Episodic motor discoordination with injury risk  
3) Severe anxiety/irritability during flares; panic physiology  
4) Autonomic surges with blood pressure spikes  
5) Non-restorative sleep and daytime fatigue  
6) Stress-linked fasting glucose elevation (metformin ineffective)  
7) Multiple medication intolerances (see cautions)

## Key Positives
- Clear stress reactivity pattern with autonomic features (adrenergic + histaminergic signatures).
- Beneficial agent pattern: α2-agonism, H1/H2 antagonism, endocrine re-equilibration, methylation support, ATP buffering, sedating 5-HT2A/CB1 modulation.

## Key Negatives / Intolerances
- Opioids (incl. tramadol): very bad reactions.
- Gabapentin: severe personality change.
- SSRIs/SNRIs (lexapro, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine), bupropion, lithium, benzos (Xanax), depakote, lamotrigine: paradoxical/behavioral activation or poor tolerability.
- Common antihypertensives poorly tolerated (lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine).

## Current Helpful Agents (with mechanistic rationale)
- Testosterone ± anastrozole — endocrine/anabolic support; improves drive/energy; may steady cortisol/glucose balance.  
- Clonidine — central α2 agonism; blunts sympathetic surges → fewer BP spikes/anxiety.  
- Hydroxyzine, Famotidine, DAO enzymes — histamine axis control; improved sleep/anxiety.  
- Quetiapine (Seroquel) — sedating 5-HT2A/H1 block; restores sleep architecture, reduces rumination.  
- Creatine, HMB — energy buffering/anti-catabolic; improve resilience/coordination.  
- Methylated B-complex, SAMe — monoamine synthesis/methylation support; improve clarity/mood.  
- CBD/THC — CB1/CB2 modulation; anxiolysis/analgesia/sedation (CBD-dominant daytime).

## Testing/Workup Considerations
- Autonomic: seated/standing BP/HR logs during episodes; consider ambulatory BP or HRV snapshot.  
- Endocrine/Metabolic: fasting glucose/insulin/C-peptide around flares; AM cortisol if clinically indicated.  
- Sleep: screen for insomnia/sleep fragmentation; consider actigraphy if symptoms persist.  
- Histamine/Mast-cell phenotype: correlate diet/symptoms; trial documentation with DAO/H1/H2 timing.

## Requests for Next Clinician Visit
- Review contraindicated agents and adverse reactions; record as formal cautions.  
- Discuss clonidine titration/PRN protocol for stress surges.  
- Evaluate testosterone/estradiol targets and anastrozole dose to avoid low-E2.  
- Align sleep plan (hydroxyzine vs quetiapine minimal effective dose; CBD/THC timing).  
- Consider metabolic follow-up plan given metformin nonresponse (stress/HPA predominant).

### Exacerbants
Episodes reliably triggered by **high-histamine foods** or **excess folate**, producing identical symptom clusters to stress-induced flares.  
Findings consistent with **mast-cell activation overlap**; responsive to **H1/H2 blockade** and **DAO enzyme support**.

### Genetics (summary)
Clearance pattern consistent with **COMT-Met**, **UGT1A1*28 tag**, **CYP3A4*22/CYP3A5*3**, **SULT1E1** variants, and **SHBG↑** alleles → favors **estrogen/catechol persistence**. See `docs/genetic_findings.md`.

### Genetics — practical implications (summary)
- **Slower estrogen clearance** likely (CYP3A4*22 ± CYP3A5*3), compounded by **reduced Phase II** (UGT1A1*28, SULT1E1 var) → sensitive to **E2 accumulation**; keep free E2 in lower-physiologic range; monitor SHBG.
- **COMT Val158Met** → lower catechol methylation capacity during stress; aligns with adrenergic/hyperarousal amplification.
- **Management hooks:** gentle aromatase control; avoid high histamine/folate spikes; leverage creatine (methylation-sparing) strategy; use clonidine/H1/H2/DAO per clinical judgment.

## Genetics
Variants indicate **slower estrogen clearance** (CYP3A4*22 ± CYP3A5*3) and **reduced Phase II conjugation** (UGT1A1*28, SULT1E1 var) with **COMT Val158Met** influencing catechol handling.  
See `docs/genetics.md` for tables and interpretation.

Genetics (summary)
:  Clearance pattern consistent with **COMT-Met**, **UGT1A1*28**, **CYP3A4*22/3A5*3**, **SULT1E1** variants, and **SHBG↑** alleles → favors estrogen/catechol persistence.  
  *Implication:* gentle aromatase control, avoid large folate spikes, maintain methyl-sparing (creatine) & methyl-B support; use sympatholysis per clinical judgment. See `docs/genetic_findings.md`.
