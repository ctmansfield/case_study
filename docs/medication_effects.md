# Medication Effects — Beneficials, Intolerances, Ineffective

> Columns meant for clinician review; dose/timing can be refined.

## A. Beneficial / Helpful
| Agent | Proposed Mechanism | Typical Dose (user) | Timing | Observed Benefit | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **Testosterone** | ↑ dopaminergic tone; ↑ muscle glucose uptake; ↓ catabolic drive | TBD | AM | ↑ drive/energy; steadier BG | Monitor T:E2; see anastrozole |
| **Anastrozole** | ↓ aromatization → T:E balance | TBD | QOD/QW | ↓ water retention; steadier mood | Avoid too-low E2 |
| **Clonidine** | central α2 agonist → ↓ sympathetic outflow | TBD | PRN/HS | ↓ BP spikes, anxiety/hyperarousal | Titrate with clinician |
| **Hydroxyzine** | H1 ± 5-HT2A block → sedation/anxiolysis | TBD | HS/PRN | Better sleep; less agitation | Anticholinergic cautions |
| **Famotidine** | H2 block → ↓ histamine vascular/HR effects | TBD | PM/with meals | ↓ nocturnal arousals | Synergy with H1/DAO |
| **DAO enzymes** | Degrade dietary histamine before absorption | Label | With meals | Fewer food-triggered flares | Meal-timed |
| **Creatine** | ↓ SAMe demand; ATP buffer | 3–5 g | AM | ↓ flare freq/intensity; better coordination | Methylation sparing |
| **Methylated B complex** | Cofactors for monoamine synthesis | Label | AM | ↑ clarity/energy | Watch activation |
| **SAMe** | Methyl donor; supports HNMT/COMT | TBD | AM | Mood/clarity support | Balance with creatine |
| **Probiotics** | Microbiome modulation | Label | Daily | GI/immune steadier | Choose low-histamine strains |
| **HMB** | Anti-catabolic; muscle stability | 3 g | AM | ↓ motor fatigue | With training |
| **CBD/THC** | CB1/CB2 modulation | TBD | HS/PRN | ↓ hyperarousal; sleep onset | CBD-dominant daytime |
| **Quetiapine** | 5-HT2A/H1/α1 block → sleep restoration | Low | HS | Sleep consolidation | Use minimal dose |

## B. Intolerant / Adverse Reactions (avoid)
| Agent/Class | Reaction (verbatim) | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| **Opioids (incl. tramadol)** | “very bad reactions” | Severe | Avoid |
| **Gabapentin** | Severe personality changes | Severe | Avoid rechallenge |
| **SSRIs** (lexapro, Prozac) | Uncontrollable/strange behavior | Severe | Avoid |
| **SNRIs** (venlafaxine, duloxetine) | As above | Severe | Avoid |
| **Bupropion (Wellbutrin)** | Paradoxical activation | Severe | Avoid |
| **Lithium** | Intolerance | Severe | Avoid |
| **Benzos (Xanax)** | Poor tolerability | Var | Avoid when possible |
| **Depakote, Lamotrigine** | Intolerance | Severe | Avoid |
| **Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Amlodipine** | Poor tolerability | Var | Avoid |

## C. Ineffective
| Agent | Outcome | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Metformin** | Ineffective | BG spikes appear stress-driven |

| Drug / Class | Mechanism | Observed Effect in Patient | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Spironolactone** (MRA) | Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism; anti-androgenic | **Bad reaction** (details to fill: BP/volume, mood, endocrine effects) | **Avoid** (document specifics on re-challenge history) |
