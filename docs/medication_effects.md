# Medication Efficacy and Mechanistic Summary

> **Purpose:** Catalog medications/supplements that *help*, explaining how and why they work systemically.  
> Include brief rationale for those that *harm* or *don’t help*, so clinicians understand mechanistic contraindications.  
> (Month/year granularity is fine — no daily tracking needed.)

## Beneficial Agents

| **Medication / Agent** | **Class / Mechanism of Action** | **Primary Systemic Targets** | **Observed Effects (Positive)** | **Mechanistic Rationale (Why It Helps)** | **Notes / Monitoring** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Testosterone** | Androgen receptor agonist; increases anabolic signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and dopaminergic tone | CNS drive, muscle, metabolic regulation | ↑energy, motivation, muscle integrity, resilience under stress | Restores anabolic–catabolic balance; boosts catecholamine tone → improved focus, reduced fatigue; supports insulin sensitivity | Monitor Hct/Hb, PSA, BP; optimize E2 ratio |
| **Anastrozole** | Aromatase inhibitor (↓conversion of T→E2) | Endocrine axis (T:E2 ratio) | Stabilizes mood, prevents estrogen excess (emotional volatility, water retention) | Prevents hyperestrogenic symptoms while preserving androgen benefits; indirectly steadies mood and energy | Avoid oversuppression (bone health risk) |
| **Clonidine** | Central α2-adrenergic agonist (↓sympathetic outflow) | Autonomic (sympathetic tone) | Blunts BP spikes, reduces tremor, calms panic physiology | Decreases norepinephrine release → reduces stress-triggered adrenergic surges → steadier BP, calmer cognition | Monitor for hypotension, sedation |
| **Famotidine** | H2 receptor antagonist | GI tract, histamine system | Calmer GI, sleep improvement, ↓agitation | Lowers systemic histamine tone → indirectly improves sleep and anxiety in histamine-sensitive individuals | Renal dosing if needed; well-tolerated |
| **Hydroxyzine** | H1/5-HT2A antagonist, sedative anxiolytic | CNS (limbic), sleep circuits | ↓anxiety, ↓irritability, better sleep continuity | H1 and 5-HT2A blockade quiets cortical arousal → reduces stress-induced insomnia and irritability | Anticholinergic; watch daytime sedation |
| **DAO enzymes** | Diamine oxidase (histamine degradation) | GI lumen, histamine metabolism | ↓post-meal agitation or flushing; improved sleep | Degrades dietary histamine before absorption → lowers histamine burden during stress, preventing sympathetic overdrive | Take with meals; potency varies by brand |
| **Creatine** | Phosphagen/ATP buffer; neuroprotective | CNS energy metabolism, muscle | ↑clarity, less cognitive fatigue | Maintains ATP during high neural demand → prevents cortical “energy crash” during stress episodes | Ensure hydration; benign profile |
| **Methylated B-complex** | Cofactors for 1-carbon metabolism (methyl-folate, methyl-B12, P5P, etc.) | Monoamine synthesis, methylation | ↑clarity, improved stress tolerance | Supports dopamine/serotonin synthesis and SAM-dependent methylation → smoother mood and cognition | May activate; take AM |
| **Probiotics** | Microbiome modulation | Gut–brain axis | Calmer baseline, improved sleep regularity | Restores short-chain fatty acid and serotonin precursors → reduces inflammation and anxiety | Strain-specific; rotate/track response |
| **HMB** (β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate) | Leucine metabolite; anti-catabolic | Muscle, metabolism | ↑physical resilience, ↓muscle soreness | Reduces proteolysis and cortisol-induced catabolism → better recovery, fewer injuries | Safe long-term; mix with protein intake |
| **SAMe** (S-adenosyl-methionine) | Universal methyl donor; cofactor in monoamine synthesis | CNS, liver | ↑motivation, ↓fatigue, improved affect | Increases methylation of monoamine precursors → boosts dopamine/serotonin tone and mitochondrial energy | Can be activating; avoid with bipolarity |
| **Quetiapine** (Seroquel) | 5-HT2A/D2/H1/α1 antagonist; sedative antipsychotic | Sleep, mood, HPA regulation | Restorative sleep, anxiolysis | Sedative 5-HT2A blockade stabilizes mood and circadian rhythm; downstream cortisol reduction aids metabolic stability | Monitor lipids, BP, metabolic markers |
| **CBD/THC** | Cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) partial agonists | CNS, limbic/autonomic circuits | ↓anxiety, pain relief, improved sleep onset | CB1 modulation dampens hyper-adrenergic response; CBD adds 5-HT1A agonism → anxiolytic synergy | Balance ratio (CBD>THC for daytime use) |

## Adverse / Contraindicated Agents

| **Medication / Agent** | **Reason for Intolerance or Risk** | **Likely Mechanistic Explanation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Lisinopril** | Worsened fatigue, hypotension | Excess ACE inhibition → ↓angiotensin II → low BP and cerebral perfusion |
| **Metoprolol** | Cognitive dulling, fatigue | β-blockade → ↓sympathetic drive → under-arousal and impaired attention |
| **Amlodipine** | Hypotension, edema | Ca²⁺ channel block → peripheral pooling → dizziness |
| **Lexapro / Prozac / Venlafaxine / Duloxetine** | Uncontrollable or strange behavior | Excess serotonergic activation → paradoxical agitation / serotonin–dopamine imbalance |
| **Xanax (alprazolam)** | Unstable rebound anxiety | Short-acting GABA_A agonism → withdrawal between doses |
| **Lithium** | Cognitive dulling | Interferes with inositol signaling and thyroid function |
| **Wellbutrin (bupropion)** | Agitation, anxiety | Dopaminergic/noradrenergic overstimulation |
| **Depakote / Lamictal** | Behavioral change, poor focus | Altered GABA/glutamate tone → emotional blunting |
| **Gabapentin** | Severe personality change | α2δ Ca²⁺ modulation → paradoxical dysphoria |
| **Opioids / Tramadol** | Very bad reaction | μ-agonism → dysphoria, histamine release, possible paradoxical excitation |

## Ineffective or Neutral

| **Medication / Agent** | **Outcome** | **Comments** |
|---|---|---|
| **Metformin** | No benefit observed | Mechanism (hepatic gluconeogenesis suppression) not primary in stress-driven glucose spikes; likely secondary HPA-axis cause rather than insulin resistance |
