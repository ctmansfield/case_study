# Symptom Log (Clustered)

## Session 2 – Quick answers (filled 2025-11-08)
- **Episode awareness:** Often **not noticed until they’re over**; recognition is retrospective.
- **Phenotype (mixed bag):** wild fasting **BG spikes**, **migraines**, **lost sleep**, **agitation**, **hyperarousal**, **hypertension**, **swelling** (post-op foot), **mood swings**, **exhaustion/lethargy**, **light sensitivity**, **heightened smell**, **dulled senses**, feeling “**retarded**/divorced from surroundings,” **memory loss**, **loss of coordination**, **falls**, **presyncope**, and more.
- **Frequency / drivers:** Associated with **stress / adrenergic response**; triggered by **rapid BG peaks/dips** and **unnecessary antagonism**.
- **Duration:** Symptoms **reinforce each other**; can persist **weeks–months**; when on many of the “bad” meds, **years**.
- **Severity trajectory:** **Worsens with each episode**; **no full recovery** of cognitive loss reported.
- **Alleviators:** **Clonidine**, proactive **H1/H2 blockade** (hydroxyzine/famotidine + DAO enzymes), **box breathing**, **light exercise**, **sauna/hot tub**, **strength training**, **maintaining flat BG**.
- **Day-after effects:** Depend on how long symptoms persisted and reinforced; fatigue/fog, lethargy, variable autonomic/metabolic drift.

## Symptom Table (updated)

| Cluster | Symptom Details | Onset Pattern | Frequency | Duration | Severity (0–10) | Triggers | Alleviating Factors | After-effects | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cognitive** | Loss of cognitive function; memory lapses; “divorced from surroundings”; confusion over simple tasks; subjective cognitive decline | Often **unrecognized until post-episode**; subtle prodrome | Stress-linked; clusters co-occur with anxiety/sleep issues | **Days→weeks**, can persist **months**; cumulative | **8–10** at peak; **progressively worsening** | Stress/adrenergic surges; BG volatility; antagonism | Clonidine; flat BG; breathing; light exercise; strength training; sleep support | Next-day fatigue/fog; slowed processing | Reports **no full recovery** between episodes |
| **Motor/Coordination** | Uncoordination; **falls**; near-miss injuries; **presyncope** | Emerges with cognitive/adrenergic flares | With cognitive/anxiety clusters | Days→weeks; worse when sleep-deprived | 6–9 | Stress; BG peaks/dips | Light exercise; strength; pacing; safety measures | Soreness; injury risk | Swelling in **post-op foot** during flares |
| **Psychiatric/Anxiety** | Severe **agitation**, **hyperarousal**, **mood swings** | Sudden with stressor; can escalate | Episodic; tied to antagonism/stress | Hours→days (can chain) | 7–10 | Stress; conflict; BG swings | **Clonidine**, **hydroxyzine**, breathing; CBD-dominant | Crash, irritability | Mark autonomic link |
| **Sleep** | **Lost sleep**, non-restorative sleep; insomnia during flares | Onset with stress day; fragmentation overnight | Several nights per flare | Nights to weeks | 7–10 | Stress, histamine load | Hydroxyzine, quetiapine (if used), CBD/THC, **famotidine/DAO** | Daytime somnolence; cognitive fog | Consider circadian hygiene |
| **Endocrine/Metabolic** | **Wild fasting BG spikes** under stress | During/after stressors | Variable; tracks stress load | Days→weeks; longer when clusters reinforce | n/a (quantify) | Cortisol/adrenergic state; sleep loss | Flat BG (diet, timing), stress reduction, training | Lethargy; crash | **Metformin ineffective** |
| **Autonomic/Histamine Axis** | **Hypertension** spikes; **light sensitivity**; **heightened smell**; histamine-like agitation | Rapid with stress; may persist | With anxiety/sleep clusters | Hours→days | 7–10 | Stress; histamine burden | **Clonidine**, **H1/H2 blockade**, **DAO** | Headache/migraine, fatigue | Photophobia prominent during flares |

## Pharmacologic Links — Session 2 Integration
*(From prior step; keep in sync with medication_effects.md)*

| Cluster | Key Symptoms | Primary Beneficial Agents | Mechanistic Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cognitive | Confusion, loss of focus, memory lapses | Testosterone, Creatine, Methyl-B Complex, SAMe | ↑dopaminergic tone + ATP buffering → less post-stress cognitive fog |
| Motor / Coordination | Uncoordination, near-miss injuries | HMB, Creatine, Testosterone | Supports muscle ATP & neuromotor stability during adrenergic loads |
| Psychiatric / Anxiety | Severe anxiety, irritability | Clonidine, Hydroxyzine, CBD/THC, SAMe | α₂-agonism + serotonergic modulation dampen limbic hyperarousal |
| Sleep | Non-restorative, fragmented sleep | Quetiapine, Hydroxyzine, CBD/THC, Famotidine | H1/5-HT2A & CB1 modulation restore sleep depth/circadian rhythm |
| Endocrine / Metabolic | Fasting glucose spikes | Testosterone, SAMe, Probiotics, HMB | Rebalances anabolic/catabolic tone; ↓cortisol; ↑insulin sensitivity |
| Autonomic / Histamine Axis | BP spikes, flushing, agitation | Clonidine, DAO, Famotidine, Hydroxyzine | ↓sympathetic outflow + histamine degradation/blockade |


### Session 2 Addendum – MCAS Link (2025-11-08)
Patient notes that **flares mirror Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)** patterns exactly.  
Symptoms reproducible with **high-histamine foods** or **excess folate** intake, producing identical cascades of hyperarousal, cognitive fog, and post-episode exhaustion.  
→ Confirms **mast-cell / histamine-driven amplification** of existing adrenergic and metabolic responses.
