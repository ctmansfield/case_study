## Session 2 – Quick answers (fill briefly; month/year OK)

- Typical episode (bullet the sequence: **early warnings → peak → recovery**):
- Average episode **duration** and **recovery time**:
- **Frequency** (per week/month; clusters that co-occur):
- **Severity** (0–10) at peak for:
  - Cognitive loss:
  - Uncoordination/injury risk:
  - Anxiety/irritability:
  - Sleep disruption:
  - Fasting glucose spike (baseline vs spike):
- **Triggers** besides stress (if any):
- **Alleviating** factors that reliably help:
- Notable **after-effects** the next day:

## Pharmacologic Links — Session 2 Integration

| Cluster | Key Symptoms | Primary Beneficial Agents | Mechanistic Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cognitive | Confusion, loss of focus, memory lapses | Testosterone, Creatine, Methyl-B Complex, SAMe | Enhances dopaminergic tone and ATP buffering → reduces post-stress cognitive fog |
| Motor / Coordination | Uncoordination, near-miss injuries | HMB, Creatine, Testosterone | Supports muscle ATP and neuromuscular stability during adrenergic surges |
| Psychiatric / Anxiety | Severe anxiety, irritability | Clonidine, Hydroxyzine, CBD/THC, SAMe | α₂-agonism and serotonergic modulation dampen limbic hyperarousal |
| Sleep | Non-restorative, fragmented sleep | Quetiapine, Hydroxyzine, CBD/THC, Famotidine | H1/5-HT2A and CB1 modulation restore sleep depth and circadian rhythm |
| Endocrine / Metabolic | Fasting glucose spikes | Testosterone, SAMe, Probiotics, HMB | Rebalances anabolic/catabolic tone, lowers cortisol, improves insulin sensitivity |
| Autonomic / Histamine Axis | BP spikes, flushing, agitation | Clonidine, DAO, Famotidine, Hydroxyzine | Reduces histamine and sympathetic outflow synergy |
