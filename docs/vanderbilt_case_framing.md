# Vanderbilt Case Framing – Prolonged-Fasting Hyperglycemia with Delayed Ketogenesis
**Patient:** Chad T. Mansfield  
**Supervising team:** VA Endocrinology & MICU (72-h fast)

## 1) One-paragraph executive summary
During a supervised 72-hour fast, fasting glucose remained elevated (120–140 mg/dL) with suppressed early ketogenesis (<0.2 mmol/L β-hydroxybutyrate), only transitioning to ketosis after quetiapine administration near the end of the fast. This pattern, plus historical response to tirzepatide, supports hepatic-selective insulin resistance with sympathetic/HPA dominance and impaired mitochondrial substrate switching. Post-GLP-1 withdrawal physiology has been problematic; tirzepatide previously normalized fasting glucose and improved function.

---

## 2) Key problems & hypotheses
- **Problem A:** Fasting hyperglycemia with absent/late ketogenesis  
  **Hypothesis:** Hepatic-selective insulin resistance with cortisol/glucagon dominance blocks lipolysis and ketogenesis; central sympathetic drive contributes.  
- **Problem B:** Exercise HR plateau <100 bpm with dyspnea before glycolytic transition  
  **Hypothesis:** Mitochondrial inflexibility/redox stress limits switching; autonomic overactivity augments.  
- **Problem C:** Low DHEA-S with mid-AM cortisol; MCAS-like symptom clusters; E2 sensitivity on TRT  
  **Hypothesis:** HPA rigidity with reduced 17,20-lyase flux; histamine/autonomic inputs amplify metabolic rigidity.

## 4) Objective data (most recent)
- **Fasting glucose:** 131 mg/dL; **Insulin:** 10.5 µIU/mL; **C-peptide:** 2.0 ng/mL  
- **β-HB:** <0.2 mmol/L (absent/low)  
- **Cortisol (AM):** 11 µg/dL; **DHEA-S:** 42 µg/dL  
- **ALT/AST:** 46/32 U/L (mild hepatic stress)  
- **Lipids:** LDL 106, HDL 48, TG 112 mg/dL  
- **Platelets:** 143 K/µL (borderline low)  
- Thyroid panel euthyroid; rt3 mildly elevated (stress-adaptive).

**Interpretation:** Hepatic insulin resistance with suppressed ketogenesis; HPA dominance; mitochondrial inflexibility. Pattern improved historically on dual incretin therapy.

## 5) Differential diagnosis (ranked likelihood)
1. Hepatic-selective insulin resistance with sympathetic/HPA dominance (most likely)  
2. Mitochondrial substrate-switching defect (functional/ acquired > primary)  
3. Atypical autonomic dysfunction/MCAS interplay affecting catechol-estrogen/catecholamine clearance  
4. Adrenal partial insufficiency vs rigidity (less likely; AM cortisol okay, DHEA-S low)  
5. Insulinoma/endo-hyperinsulinemia (unlikely given fasting insulin/C-pep)

---

## 6) Proposed confirmatory workup (prioritized)
- **Counter-regulation:** glucagon, acylcarnitines + total/free carnitine, lactate/pyruvate  
- **Metabolic switching:** fasting β-HB trajectory during 6-h mini-fast; FFA  
- **Endocrine context:** AM cortisol + DHEA-S trend; ACTH; IGF-1 (± IGFBP-3)  
- **Autonomic:** active stand test, HRV diary; morning symptom pattern 5–6 AM  
- **Optional:** OAT or mito panel if clinically available

---

## 7) Therapeutic implications
- **Reinitiate tirzepatide** (2.5 mg → 5 mg as tolerated): previously normalized fasting glucose and improved function; mechanistic fit (GLP-1/GIP: suppress glucagon, enhance hepatic insulin signaling, improve adipose/mitochondrial coupling).  
- **TRT hygiene:** micro-dosing schedule with stable AI; maintain hCG; reassess DHEA-S once E2 stable.  
- **Non-pharm:** circadian anchors; graded Zone-2; protein-first refeeds; MCAS-aware diet.

---

## 8) Why tirzepatide (mechanistic bullets)
- GLP-1/GIP dual action → **glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect** + **glucagon suppression**  
- Hepatic signaling: improves **hepatic insulin sensitivity** beyond weight loss; reduces HGP  
- Adiponectin/GIP synergy → supports **mitochondrial biogenesis** and substrate switching  
- Patient-specific: historical efficacy; aligns with fast phenotype (quetiapine → ketosis suggests central/ANS gate)

---

## 9) Learning points (journal-style)
- Fasting hyperglycemia with suppressed ketogenesis can reflect **central/ANS-amplified hepatic IR**.  
- **Quetiapine-associated drop in sympathetic tone** coinciding with ketosis onset is a useful physiologic probe.  
- Dual incretin therapy may restore **metabolic flexibility** where metformin/lifestyle alone fail.
