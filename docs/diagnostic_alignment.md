# Diagnostic Alignment (for clinician review)

## MCAS / Histamine-Driven Physiology
- Recurrent multi-system flares (neuro, cardio/autonomic, sleep, GI/edema).
- **Triggers:** high-histamine foods; excess folate; stress.
- **Response:** H1 (hydroxyzine), H2 (famotidine), **DAO** → improved sleep/arousal.
- Note: **Normal tryptase does not exclude MCAS**.

## Adrenergic Dysregulation / Autonomic Surges
- BP spikes, HR variability, hyperarousal; **clonidine** responsive.

## Estrogen Handling — Genotype with Phenotype Expression
- **CYP3A4*22 + CYP3A5*3** → slower E2 clearance.
- **UGT1A1*28 tag** → reduced glucuronidation.
- **COMT Val158Met (Met)** → slower catechol methylation.
- Clinical: sensitivity when E2 is high; improved with precise anastrozole titration.

## Stress-Linked Metabolic Dysfunction
- Fasting/postprandial glucose spikes during flares; headaches when **BG <110 mg/dL**.
