# Diagnostic Alignment (Clinician-Facing)

## A) Mast Cell–Mediated Symptom Complex (MCAS physiology, non-clonal)
- Recurrent **multi-system** episodes: neurologic (cognitive slowing, photophobia), psychiatric (hyperarousal/anxiety), cardiovascular (**BP variability**), endocrine/metabolic (**fasting BG↑**, postprandial spikes), edema (post-op foot).
- **Dietary histamine sensitivity** and **excess folate** reliably reproduce episodes.
- **Therapeutic response**: benefit with **H1 (hydroxyzine)** + **H2 (famotidine)** and **DAO** co-administered with meals.
- **Stress** is a non-dietary trigger; episodes mirror MCAS flares.
- Note: **Normal tryptase does not exclude MCAS**; phenotype and response-to-blockade are supportive.

## B) Adrenergic Dysregulation / Autonomic Surges
- Features: **paroxysmal hypertension**, tremor/inner agitation, insomnia/fragmented sleep, cognitive “noise,” presyncope/falls.
- **Clonidine** (central α2 agonist) attenuates flares (↓NE outflow), consistent with an adrenergic amplification loop.
- Breathing/pacing improve symptoms (↑vagal tone).

## C) Estrogen-Handling Genotype with Clinical Expression
- **Slower clearance pathways**: CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3 (non-expressor), **UGT1A1*28 tag**, SULT1E1 promoter variant; **COMT Val158Met** (Met) → slower catechol estrogen & catecholamine methylation.
- **Phenotype**: Sensitive to estrogen elevation; requires careful **anastrozole** titration; stress reactivity worsens when E2 is higher.

## D) Stress-Linked Metabolic Dysregulation
- Episodes associate with **hyperglycemia** (fasting and postprandial); patient develops **headache when BG < 110 mg/dL** during recovery window.
- Sleep disruption and adrenergic tone track with glucose variability.
