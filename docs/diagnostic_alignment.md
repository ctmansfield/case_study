# Diagnostic Alignment (for clinician review)

## MCAS / Histamine-Driven Physiology
- Recurrent multi-system flares (neuro, cardio/autonomic, sleep, GI/edema).
- **Triggers:** high-histamine foods; excess folate; stress.
- **Response:** H1 (hydroxyzine), H2 (famotidine), **DAO** → improved sleep/arousal.
- Note: **Normal tryptase does not exclude MCAS**.

## Adrenergic Dysregulation / Autonomic Surges
- BP spikes, HR variability, hyperarousal; **clonidine** responsive.

## Estrogen Handling — Genotype with Phenotype Expression
- **CYP3A4*22 + CYP3A5*3** → slower E2 clearance.
- **UGT1A1*28 tag** → reduced glucuronidation.
- **COMT Val158Met (Met)** → slower catechol methylation.
- Clinical: sensitivity when E2 is high; improved with precise anastrozole titration.

## Stress-Linked Metabolic Dysfunction
- Fasting/postprandial glucose spikes during flares; headaches when **BG <110 mg/dL**.

## Neurodevelopmental Context — Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

The patient carries a formal diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  
This diagnosis is relevant to interpretation of autonomic, sensory, and metabolic findings for several reasons:

- **Autonomic Regulation Differences:** Autistic adults frequently demonstrate elevated sympathetic tone, reduced vagal flexibility, and exaggerated catecholamine responses during stress. This context aligns with the patient’s documented episodic adrenergic surges, cortisol-driven reactivity, and delayed physiologic recovery.

- **Interoceptive Variability:** Differences in internal signal processing in ASD can alter the perception and modulation of physiologic stress, often amplifying autonomic responses without implying psychiatric etiology.

- **Medication Sensitivity:** ASD is associated with atypical pharmacodynamic responses and heightened sensitivity to CNS-active medications. This provides a coherent explanation for the patient’s documented paradoxical and exaggerated medication reactions.

- **Stress Physiology:** Literature demonstrates higher baseline HPA activation in autistic adults. This supports the patient’s pattern of stress-driven glucose elevation, sympathetic activation, and episodic metabolic disruption.

Incorporating ASD as a known diagnostic factor clarifies several physiologic patterns already documented in this case and provides appropriate context for differential diagnosis.
