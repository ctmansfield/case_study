# Diagnostic Alignment (Non-diagnostic, framework mapping)

This document maps observed data to established diagnostic frameworks to aid clinician interpretation.

## MCAS (Non-clonal)
- ≥2 organ systems during episodes (neuro, GI, derm/flush, cardio-autonomic).
- Trigger patterns: high-histamine foods, stress, sleep loss.
- Response patterns: H1/H2, DAO, clonidine for adrenergic surge.
- Note: baseline tryptase may be normal in non-clonal MCAS.

## Autonomic/Adrenergic Dysregulation
- BP/HR episodic surges, morning 5–6am lows, hypervigilance.
- Improvement with alpha-2 agonist (clonidine) consistent with adrenergic contribution.
- Consider active stand test + HRV.

## Endocrine/Metabolic
- Prolonged fasting: elevated glucose, low insulin/C-pep, suppressed early ketones, late BHB rise.
- Suggests central nutrient-sensing/HPA rigidity + impaired mitochondrial substrate switching.

## Estrogen-Handling Genotype → Phenotype
- COMT Met, CYP3A4*22, UGT1A1*28: slower catechol/estrogen clearance → stress sensitivity and E2 symptoms.
