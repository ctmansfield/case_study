# Diagnostic Alignment (Detailed)

## 1. Mast Cell–Associated Symptom Complex (MCAS-like)
Criteria supported:
- Recurrent episodes involving ≥2 systems  
- Reproducible triggers: dietary histamine and folate overload  
- Documented improvement with H1, H2 blockade and DAO  
- No requirement for elevated tryptase in non-clonal MCAS  
- Pattern consistent with mast-cell mediator physiology  

## 2. Adrenergic Dysregulation / Autonomic Surges
- Paroxysmal hypertension  
- Elevated HR during episodes  
- Tremor, internal “voltage” sensation  
- Abrupt improvement with clonidine  
- Sleep disruption that aligns with autonomic arousal  

## 3. Estrogen-Handling Variant Cluster
Variants indicating reduced clearance:
- CYP3A4*22  
- CYP3A5*3  
- COMT Met  
- UGT1A1*28 tag  
- SULT1E1 regulatory changes  

Clinical translation: heightened sensitivity to hormone shifts, adrenergic load, and inflammatory triggers.

## 4. Stress/Metabolic Linkage
- Stress → cortisol → fasting glucose elevation  
- Reliable headaches when glucose drops <110 mg/dL  
- Matches impaired metabolic resilience in adrenergic physiology
