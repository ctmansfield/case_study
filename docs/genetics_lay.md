## Genetics (plain language)

Your genes suggest your body clears **estrogen more slowly** and may **recycle stress chemicals more slowly** during stressful times.  
That can make stress “surges” feel stronger and last longer. Practical steps you’re already using—keeping estradiol in range, using creatine and methyl-B support, and calming the nervous system—match this pattern.
