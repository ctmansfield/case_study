# Case Study — Lay Summary (Patient & Family Reference)

This version explains your medical findings in plain language, keeping technical accuracy while removing jargon.

## Overview
You experience strong reactions to stress, certain foods, and medications. These reactions come from your body releasing too much of certain “fight-or-flight” chemicals (like adrenaline and histamine). This can cause trouble thinking clearly, poor sleep, blood pressure spikes, and fatigue.

## What’s Going On
Your genes show that your body clears some hormones (especially estrogen) more slowly than usual. That means they can build up and cause symptoms like swelling, anxiety, and poor sleep if not balanced carefully. Your system also uses up “methylation” nutrients faster during stress, which can worsen these episodes.

## Medications and Sensitivities
You react badly to some drugs, especially opioids, gabapentin, and antidepressants that increase serotonin. Spironolactone caused fatigue and brain fog. These reactions are consistent with your body’s slower detox and heightened sensitivity.

## Why Blood Sugar Matters
When your blood sugar drops below ~110 mg/dL, you get headaches and irritability. Keeping stable blood sugar helps avoid these stress reactions.

## Big Picture
These patterns show that your symptoms are not random — they reflect how your nervous system, hormones, and metabolism interact. With the right management (stress pacing, careful diet, and medication awareness), you can reduce flare-ups and recover faster.
