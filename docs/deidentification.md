# De-identification & Privacy Guide

- Prefer **month/year** for dates. Avoid exact dates unless medically critical.
- Use initials or role (e.g., “PT,” “PCP”), not full names.
- Remove identifiers: addresses, phone numbers, MRNs, claim numbers.
- Photos/images: strip EXIF; blur faces/IDs.
- When quoting messages/notes, paraphrase; mark with *(paraphrased)*.
- For device screenshots, crop to the data only.
- If unsure, add to a private note (not committed) and summarize here instead.
