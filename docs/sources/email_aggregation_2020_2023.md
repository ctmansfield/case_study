## 2023-07-27 — Lamotrigine refill lapse (dose 300 mg/day)
**Quote:** “I’ve been without now for most of this week… I fear that would be too long a wait.”

**Tone:** polite, organized request; coherent.

## 2023-02-15 — Missed appointment after “extremely horrible night”
**Quote:** “I had an extremely horrible night last night and overslept.”  
**Signals:** severe nocturnal disruption → hypersomnia/oversleep; likely flare carryover.  
**Tone:** apologetic, concise.

## 2023-02-09 — Global apology to care team
**Quote:** “I’m mortified, embarrassed and remorseful… none of it helped get what I needed.”  
**Signals:** insight preserved; post-episode remorse common after adrenergic/histamine surges.  
**Tone:** contrite; structured paragraphing.

## 2022-11-23 — “Care team transfer / re-exposure trigger”
**Quote (multiple):** “derailed immediately by the tension, anxiety, stress and trauma…”
**Signals:** acute hyperarousal with **situational re-trigger**; marked autonomic/cognitive escalation.  
**Tone:** distressed but linear; affective intensity ↑.

## 2022-10-25 — Request for higher-acuity help
**Quote:** “I am not ok… I need inpatient care… I cannot go to [facility].”

### Cross-cutting symptom themes from emails
- **Nocturnal dysregulation** → “horrible night,” oversleep, non-restorative sleep.
- **Hyperarousal/adrenergic surges** → agitation, anxiety, BP variability; situational triggers.
- **Cognitive/affective aftermath** → remorse, embarrassment, perceived incoherence during flares; insight returns post-episode.
- **Medication sensitivities** → duloxetine, gabapentin worsened behavior/cognition; lamotrigine lapse anxiety.
- **Safety risk during peaks** → historical suicidality when on serotonergic load.
- **Communication pattern** → during flares: heightened intensity; after: organized, reflective.
