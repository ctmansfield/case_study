## 2025-11-08 — Session 2: Post-Episode Pattern Characterization
**Context:** Retrospective awareness of multi-system stress-triggered episodes established.  
**Highlights:**
- **Recognition lag:** episodes usually realized **after resolution**.
- **Symptom constellation:** cognitive loss, uncoordination, presyncope, migraines, hyperarousal, hypertension, post-op swelling, light sensitivity, hyperosmia, lethargy, mood swings.
- **Drivers:** adrenergic stress response and glucose volatility (rapid peaks/dips or antagonism).  
- **Course:** mutually reinforcing symptoms lasting **weeks→months**; historically **years** on intolerant meds.
- **Progression:** cumulative cognitive deficit noted with successive flares.
- **Relief factors:** clonidine, proactive H1/H2 blockade (hydroxyzine + famotidine + DAO), box-breathing, flat BG, light exercise, sauna/hot-tub, strength training.
- **After-effects:** fatigue, fog, metabolic drift; variable recovery.
