# Emergency / First-Look Summary

**Key risks:** presyncope/falls during flares; BP volatility; cognitive lapses; injury risk.

**Do NOT use / avoid (severe intolerances):** opioids (incl. tramadol), gabapentin, SSRIs/SNRIs, bupropion, lithium, benzodiazepines (if avoidable), depakote, lamotrigine; lisinopril, metoprolol, amlodipine.

**Often Helpful (patient-reported):** clonidine (α2 agonist), hydroxyzine (H1), famotidine (H2), DAO at meals, creatine, breathing/pacing, sleep support.

**Known triggers:** high-histamine foods; **excess folate**; psychosocial antagonism/stress; sleep deficit.

**Suggested immediate approach (non-directive for clinicians):**  
- Consider H1/H2 and clonidine per clinician judgment; hydrate; low-histamine nutrition; calm, low-stimulus setting.  
- Evaluate for injury if falls/near-misses.  
- If labs possible during event: histamine/tryptase, CRP, glucose, vitals log.

**Contacts / Next steps:** attach clinician brief; schedule follow-up with primary team.
