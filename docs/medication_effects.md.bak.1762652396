# Medication Efficacy and Mechanistic Summary

> **Purpose:** Track medications/supplements that *help*, with mechanistic rationale (biochemical/systemic) and observed functional benefits.
> Keep entries concise and clinician-readable. Month/year granularity is fine.

## Summary Table

| **Medication / Agent** | **Class / Mechanism of Action** | **Primary Systemic Targets** | **Observed Effects (Positive)** | **How / Why It Helps (Mechanistic Rationale)** | **Dosing / Timing (if relevant)** | **Notes / Tolerability** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Mechanism Glossary (quick cues)
- **CNS stabilization:** ↑GABAergic tone / ↓excitatory glutamate → mitigates stress-provoked cortical overload → clearer thinking, fewer coordination lapses.
- **Autonomic regulation:** ↓sympathetic output (β-blockade / central sympatholytic / adaptogenic) → blunts HR/BP spikes, tremor, panic physiology.
- **HPA axis modulation:** dampens cortisol surges → reduces “crash” and next-day fatigue; may stabilize fasting glucose under stress.
- **Metabolic balance:** ↑insulin sensitivity or ↓gluconeogenesis (e.g., metformin-like effects, diet/supplement strategies) → smooths fasting glucose variability.
- **Sleep architecture support:** melatoninergic / GABAergic / orexin modulation → ↑restorative sleep → improved daytime cognition/coordination.

## Template for a New Entry

**Medication / Agent:**  
**Mechanism / Class:**  
**Systemic Targets:** (CNS inhibitory tone, sympathetic tone, HPA axis, metabolic, sleep/wake)  
**Observed Positive Effects:** (what you actually feel/observe)  
**Mechanistic “Why it helps”:** (1–2 lines linking MoA → your symptom clusters)  
**Dosing / Timing (optional):**  
**Notes / Tolerability:** (side effects, interactions, boundaries)

## Update Procedure
1. Add a new row to the table above.
2. If needed, append a short paragraph under a new `### <Medication>` subheading for nuance (PK/PD timing, interaction with stress events).
3. Commit with a clear message, e.g. `feat(meds): add <med> with CNS stabilization rationale`.

> Tip: If an agent helps only a **specific cluster** (e.g., sleep or anxiety), mention that cluster by name so we can cross-reference to `docs/symptom_log.md`.
