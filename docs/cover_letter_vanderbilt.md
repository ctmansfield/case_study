**Subject:** Case framing + rationale for tirzepatide renewal (data attached)

Dear Drs. Niswender and Pruett,

Thank you for supervising my 72-hour fast and for your time. I assembled a concise case framing that integrates the fast results, subsequent labs (11/12/2025), and prior response to tirzepatide.

- The physiology during fasting showed persistent hyperglycemia with suppressed ketogenesis that only shifted after quetiapine, suggesting central/ANS-amplified hepatic insulin resistance and impaired mitochondrial substrate switching.  
- Historically, tirzepatide normalized fasting glucose and improved function; metformin did not.  
- I included a brief workup plan and figures (timelines and, pending export, device-based trends).

Attachments/Repo items:
- `docs/vanderbilt_case_framing.md` – full case framing  
- `docs/tirzepatide_rationale.md` – renewal rationale  
- `figures/timeline_fast_case.png`, `figures/three_lane_timeline.png`  
- `data/labs_2025-11-12.csv`, `data/labs_trend.csv`

I’m grateful for your consideration and guidance on confirmatory testing and next steps.

Respectfully,
