# Case Study Evidence Enhancers

## 1. Orthostatic Testing
Record:
- Supine HR/BP × 5 min  
- Standing HR/BP × 10 min  

## 2. Histamine Trigger Correlation
Document:
- Specific food  
- Timing  
- Symptoms  
- Response to H1/H2/DAO  

## 3. Stress Challenge Correlation
- Describe stressor  
- Capture BP/HR/glucose within 10–30 min  
- Log symptom progression  

## 4. Reproducibility
Episodes reproduced ≥3× strengthen diagnostic clarity.
