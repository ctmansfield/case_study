# Case Study Enhancers (Objective Additions)

- **Orthostatic vitals (5–10 min active stand):** HR/BP trajectories → autonomic profile.
- **Histamine challenge correlation:** record meal, latency, symptom score, H1/H2/DAO timing/response.
- **Stress challenge correlation:** situational trigger → HR/BP/BG time course.
- **Reproducibility:** ≥3 occurrences of the same pattern (dietary or stress) with response to countermeasures.
