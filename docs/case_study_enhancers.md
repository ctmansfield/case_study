# Case Study Enhancers (Data to strengthen publishability)

- Orthostatic vitals (5–10 min active stand) with symptoms.
- Histamine challenge diary: food → timing → symptoms → H1/H2/DAO response.
- Stress challenge diary: stressor → HR/BP → glucose → symptom cluster.
- Reproducibility: show ≥3 episodes with similar pattern.
- Add acylcarnitine panel, OAT, lactate/pyruvate ratio if ordered.
- Document quetiapine (Seroquel) timing and ketone switching temporal link.
