# Genetics Overview — Estrogen Handling, Methylation, and Neuro-Adrenal Modulation

> **Purpose:** Summarize variants that plausibly shape estrogen metabolism/clearance, catechol & histamine handling, and adrenergic stress responses. This is **context** for clinicians, not a diagnosis.

## A. Key Variants (patient-reported / scan-confirmed)

| Pathway | Gene / Variant | Typical Functional Effect (literature) | Expected Clinical Direction of Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Catechol & catechol-estrogen methylation | **COMT rs4680 (Val158Met, Met allele)** | Lower thermal stability/activity → slower methylation of catechols | ↑ catechol/hormone noise under stress; may worsen anxiety when flux high. |
| Phase I, alternate hydroxylation | **CYP1A2 rs762551 (*1F haplotype context)** | Alters inducibility; genotype–phenotype context-dependent | If inducibility low or phenoconverted: slower caffeine/aryl metabolism; interaction with stress/sleep. |
| Hepatic estrogen clearance | **CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367)** | Reduced hepatic expression/activity | Slower E2 clearance; higher exposure at same aromatization rate. |
| Hepatic estrogen clearance (redundancy) | **CYP3A5*3 (rs776746) non-expressor** | Loss of CYP3A5 activity; shifts burden to CYP3A4 | Accentuates *3A4 load; amplifies *22 effect. |
| Glucuronidation (bilirubin, E2 metabolites) | **UGT1A1*28 (promoter; rs887829 tag for TA7)** | Lower expression → reduced glucuronidation | Slower E2 metabolite clearance; ↑ unconjugated bilirubin tendency (Gilbert-like). |
| Sulfation of estradiol | **SULT1E1 rs3736599 (promoter)** | Reported ↓ expression in some cohorts | Prolonged active E2 half-life when low sulfation. |
| Androgen/estrogen binding | **SHBG rs1799941 / rs12150660 / rs6259** | Common alleles shift SHBG levels | Alters free vs total T/E2; interacts with thyroid/liver status. |

**Interpretation (integrated):** Pattern favors **slower Phase II** (COMT-Met, UGT1A1*28, SULT1E1 var) plus **reduced CYP3A throughput** (CYP3A4*22 with CYP3A5*3) ⇒ tendency toward **higher circulating E2**, more **catechol buildup** under stress, and a **greater need for careful aromatase control** (Anastrozole titration). SHBG variants modulate free fraction, aligning with observed sensitivity when E2 > ~40 pg/mL.

## C. Clinician Notes
- Use genetics **as framing**, not fate. **Phenoconversion** (illness, sleep loss, diet, drugs) often dominates CYP1A2 and CYP3A activities.
- Track **free** E2/T plus SHBG; interpret with thyroid & liver markers.
- If E2 intolerance persists despite dose control, consider Phase II support (nutrition-guided) and histamine load mitigation as documented elsewhere.
