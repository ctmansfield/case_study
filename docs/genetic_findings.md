# Genetic Findings — Metabolism, Clearance, and Stress Axis (Working)

> Purpose: summarize variants tied to estrogen/catechol clearance, stress response, and bioenergetics that plausibly modulate this case. This is a clinical working document, not diagnostic.

## A. Estrogen Metabolism & Clearance (patient-supplied panel)

| Gene | Variant | Functional Effect | Expected Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **COMT rs4680 (Val158Met)** | Met allele | ↓ methylation of catechol estrogens & catecholamines | Slower catechol clearance → ↑ oxidative load; ↑ anxiety/insomnia sensitivity under catechol buildup |
| **CYP1A2 rs762551 (*1F*)** | Inducible | Faster 2-hydroxylation of E2 (protective route) **if induced** (e.g., caffeine) | Route effectiveness drops with hepatic load or low methyl donors |
| **CYP3A4 rs35599367 (*22*)** | Decreased expression | Slower hepatic E2 clearance | ↑ circulating E2; slower adaptation to TRT changes |
| **CYP3A5 rs776746 (*3*)** | Non-expressor | Shifts oxidative load to CYP3A4 | Accentuates *22* effect on E2 clearance |
| **UGT1A1 rs887829** | Tags *28 low-activity allele | ↓ glucuronidation | Impaired E2 conjugation/clearance; can mimic mild Gilbert’s pattern |
| **SULT1E1 rs3736599** | Promoter variant | ↓ estrogen sulfation (probable) | Prolongs active estrogen half-life |
| **SULT2A1 rs2637125** | Research variant | Alters DHEA sulfation | Aligns with low DHEAS labs |
| **SHBG rs6259 / rs12150660 / rs1799941** | ↑ SHBG alleles | Higher SHBG | ↓ free T/E2; ↑ measured totals; sensitive to thyroid/liver status |

### Interpretation (clinical)
Pattern suggests **slow phase II conjugation** (COMT-Met, UGT1A1*28, SULT1E1) plus **reduced CYP3A4/5 clearance**, favoring **estradiol accumulation** and **catechol buildup**. Explains sensitivity to **aromatase balance**, need for **careful anastrozole titration**, and symptom escalation when **E2 > ~40 pg/mL**. This dovetails with mast-cell/adrenergic susceptibility and methylation burden documented elsewhere.

## B. Global Priority Variants (selected, from patient scans)
*(Curated from uploaded priority hit tables; details retained in repo history.)*

| Gene | rsID | Genotype | Pathway | Putative Effect | Clinical Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **COMT** | rs4680 | Met | Catechol methylation | ↓ activity | Catechol estrogen & catecholamine clearance slower |
| **UGT1A1** | rs887829 (*28 tag*) | — | Glucuronidation | ↓ conjugation | ↑ unconjugated bilirubin risk; slower E2 clearance |
| **CYP3A4** | rs35599367 (*22*) | — | Oxidation | ↓ expression | Slower hepatic clearance of many substrates incl. E2 |
| **CYP3A5** | rs776746 (*3*) | — | Oxidation | Non-expressor | Shifts load to CYP3A4 → compounds *22* |
| **SULT1E1** | rs3736599 | — | Sulfation | ↓ activity (promoter) | Prolongs active estrogen |
| **SULT2A1** | rs2637125 | — | DHEA sulfation | Altered | Matches low DHEAS trend |
| **SHBG** | rs6259/rs12150660/rs1799941 | ↑ | Carrier protein | ↑ SHBG | Lowers free T/E2 fraction |

> **Provisional clinical implications:** Maintain methyl donors (B6/PLP, B12, folate balance, SAMe); support conjugation (glycine/taurine/NAC); monitor **E2, SHBG, DHEAS, liver enzymes** under TRT/AI adjustments; avoid drugs that further impair 3A4/UGT function when possible.

## C. Linkage to observed physiology
- Estrogen/catechol clearance drag → **hyperarousal**, **migraine/light sensitivity**, **sleep fragmentation** under stress.
- Conjugation bottlenecks + histamine axis → **MCAS-like** flares; improved by **DAO + H1/H2**.
- Methylation load → aligns with benefit from **creatine** and **methyl-B complex**.
