# Physician Rationale for Tirzepatide Renewal

**Patient:** Chad T. Mansfield  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Supervising Physician:** Dr. Kevin Niswender, Vanderbilt University  
**Supporting Clinician:** Dr. Pruett

## 1. Clinical Context
Mr. Mansfield demonstrates a reproducible pattern of **hepatic insulin resistance with stress-dependent glucagon dominance** and **delayed ketone generation** during fasting, consistent with the model of cortisol- and catecholamine-amplified gluconeogenesis described by Niswender and colleagues.  
While on **tirzepatide (Mounjaro)**, he exhibited:
- Normalization of fasting glucose (≈85–95 mg/dL)  
- Faster, symmetric metabolic switching during caloric restriction  
- More stable autonomic tone (better sleep/HRV; less BP volatility)

After discontinuation, he developed:
- Impaired fasting glucose (≈112–124 mg/dL)  
- Suppressed β-hydroxybutyrate during prolonged fasts (<0.2 mmol/L after 24 h)  
- Marked sympathetic activation with poor sleep consolidation and delayed ketosis transition

## 2. Mechanistic Rationale
**Dual incretin agonism (GLP-1 + GIP)** counters this physiology via hepatic and central actions:
- **GLP-1R activation** restores hepatic insulin sensitivity and suppresses inappropriate glucagon.  
- **GIPR co-activation** improves adipocyte insulin signaling/adiponectin and reduces lipolytic stress.  
- **Combined axis** lowers hepatic glucose production, improves mitochondrial substrate flexibility, and dampens HPA hyper-reactivity to fasting.

This maps tightly to the patient’s fasting phenotype (suppressed ketogenesis until sympathetic tone was pharmacologically reduced).

## 3. Clinical Indicators Supporting Renewal
| Parameter | Pre-tirzepatide | On tirzepatide | Post-withdrawal |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Fasting glucose (mg/dL) | 112–124 | **85–95** | 118 |
| Fasting β-hydroxybutyrate (mmol/L) | <0.2 | **0.4–0.7** | <0.2 |
| BP (mmHg, waking) | 142/88 ± 12 | **122/78 ± 5** | 146/86 ± 11 |
| Sleep HRV (RMSSD, ms) | 18 | **45–50** | 19 |
| AM cortisol (µg/dL) | 18.7 | **11.9** | 17.6 |

Pattern is consistent with **hepatic IR rebound** and **autonomic dysregulation** after GLP-1/GIP withdrawal.

## 4. Expected Benefit of Re-initiation
- Restore hepatic insulin sensitivity and suppress excess glucagon  
- Reduce sympathetic-mediated BP variability  
- Normalize fasting→feeding transition (earlier βHB rise, improved metabolic switch)  
- Stabilize glycemia and autonomic symptoms to enable rehab and cognitive performance

**Proposal:** restart 2.5 mg weekly → consider 5 mg as tolerated (clinician discretion). Maintain current TRT/hCG; keep AI stable pending E2 review.

## 5. VA Coverage Framing (brief)
- **Medical necessity:** Persistent metabolic dysfunction (hepatic IR, impaired fasting adaptation) with **documented prior response** to tirzepatide; failure of metformin and lifestyle alone.  
- **Risk–benefit:** GLP-1/GIP has favorable cardiometabolic and hepatic IR profiles; benefits outweigh risks in this phenotype when monitored.  
- **Monitoring plan:** q4–6 weeks fasting glucose/insulin/C-peptide/ketones; CMP/ALT/AST q6–8 weeks; BP/HRV/symptom diary; endocrinology follow-up.  
- **Alternatives tried/limited:** Metformin ineffective; SGLT2/acarbose/pioglitazone considered but less aligned with patient’s sympathetic/ketone phenotype.
