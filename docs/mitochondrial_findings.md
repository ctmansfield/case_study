# Mitochondrial & Nutrient Findings (Clinician Summary)

**Key pattern on labs:** “alcoholic pattern” aminotransferase profile with features consistent with **mitochondrial stress** and **functional vitamin B6 (PLP) deficiency**, in a non-alcohol context.

## Evidence (pull exact values from labs)
- **AST/ALT pattern:** _TBD (dates/values)_ — pattern discussed with prior clinicians as “alcoholic-type,” suggestive of mitochondrial involvement rather than hepatocellular necrosis alone.
- **B6 status (PLP):** _TBD_ — low/insufficient range on _TBD_ date(s).
- **Correlates during flares:** fatigue, migraine, photophobia, cognitive slowing, dysautonomia.

## Mechanistic interpretation (for review)
- **Mitochondrial bottlenecks** during adrenergic/histamine flares → ↑ glycolytic reliance, stress hyperglycemia, low threshold for fatigue.
- **PLP dependency** of amino acid metabolism & neurotransmitter synthesis → vulnerability to cognitive/mood instability during stress if B6 is suboptimal.

## Clinical tie-in
- Supports the broader **stress–mast-cell–adrenergic** loop and **metabolic lability** already captured in timeline & objective logs.
