# Case Study Outline

> **Privacy:** Private medical record draft. De-identify where possible. Month/year granularity is OK.

## 1. Patient Profile (De-identified)
- Year of birth: **TBD**
- Sex: **TBD**
- Dominant hand: **TBD**
- Occupation/activities: **TBD**
- Languages: **TBD**
- Lifestyle or key exposures: **TBD**

**Clinician note:** Patient prefers precise, technical communication; please record mechanisms and differential considerations succinctly.

## 2. Chief Concerns / Presenting Problems
- Recurrent **stress-triggered episodes** with:  
  - **Loss of cognitive function** and **memory lapses**  
  - **Physical uncoordination** with **increased injury risk**  
  - **Severe uncontrollable anxiety/irritability**  
  - **Blood pressure spikes** during episodes  
  - **Non-restorative sleep**  
  - **Elevated fasting blood sugar**  
Day-to-day impact includes confusion over simple tasks and safety concerns during/following flares. *(From prior notes.)*

## 3. History of Present Illness (HPI)
- **Onset & evolution:** **TBD** (earliest recollection; course over time)
- **Typical episode sequence:** **TBD** (prodrome → peak → resolution; recovery time)
- **Frequency / Duration / Severity:** **TBD**
- **Triggers/precipitants:** **Psychological/physiological stress** (known); others **TBD**
- **Alleviating/aggravating factors:** **TBD**
- **Functional impact:** cognition, coordination/safety, sleep quality

## 4. Past Medical History / Family History
- Past conditions: **TBD**
- Surgeries/hospitalizations: **TBD**
- Family history: **TBD**

## 5. Medications & Sensitivities
- Current medications/supplements: **TBD**
- **Adverse reactions (critical):**
  - **Opioids (incl. tramadol):** “very bad reactions” → **avoid**
  - **Gabapentin:** **severe personality changes** → discontinued; **avoid**
  - **Antidepressants (unspecified class):** **uncontrollable/strange behavior** → discontinued; **avoid**
- Tolerated agents / non-drug strategies: **TBD**
- See `docs/medication_history.md` for full table.
- See `docs/medication_effects.md` for **beneficial agents + mechanisms**.

- **Other systems:** **TBD**

## 7. Investigations
- See `docs/physio_tracking.md` and `docs/lab_tracking.md` for physiologic and laboratory tracking.
- Labs/imaging performed: **TBD**
- Notable results: **TBD**
- Pending tests/referrals: **TBD**

## 8. Timeline of Key Events — see `docs/timeline.md`
- Milestones summary: **TBD**

## 9. Assessment & Plan (working)
- See `docs/clinician_checklist.md` for visit-day checklist.
- See `docs/mechanisms.md` for MCAS/histamine–folate mechanisms.
- Problem list: **TBD**
- Differential considerations: **TBD**
- Requests for clinician / next steps: **TBD**

### Clinician Integration Note — Session 2
**Therapeutic pattern:**  
Episodes stabilize with agents that suppress sympathetic + histaminergic overactivation while supporting mitochondrial energy and anabolic tone.

**Mechanistic domains:**
- α2-adrenergic → *clonidine*  
- H1/H2 blockade → *hydroxyzine*, *famotidine*  
- Endocrine re-equilibration → *testosterone ± anastrozole*  
- Methylation / monoamine restoration → *SAMe*, *methyl-B complex*  
- Energy buffering → *creatine*, *HMB*  
- Sleep circuit normalization → *quetiapine*, *CBD/THC*
