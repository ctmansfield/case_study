# Comprehensive Lab Interpretation – 2025-11-12
**Patient:** Chad T. Mansfield  
**Interpreted by:** Case study automation (reviewed manually)  
**Context:** Post-fast labs under sustained hepatic insulin resistance, low ketone generation, and suspected HPA/mitochondrial dysregulation.

## - 1. Metabolic / Endocrine Findings
- **Fasting glucose 131 mg/dL + insulin 10.5 µIU/mL** → confirms hepatic insulin resistance rather than pancreatic failure.  
- **Absent β-hydroxybutyrate (<0.2 mmol/L)** after prolonged fast → impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation.  
- **C-peptide normal** → endogenous insulin still produced; not an autoimmune form.  
- **Cortisol 11 µg/dL (AM) with DHEA-S 42 µg/dL** → catabolic-dominant adrenal profile.  
- **ACTH normal** → central drive intact.  
- Pattern = *stress-adaptive glucose maintenance with suppressed androgenic output*.

**Mechanistic link:**  
Persistent cortisol tone blunts hepatic ketogenesis and inhibits CPT-1 via malonyl-CoA accumulation.  
Low DHEA-S implies reduced 17,20-lyase flux (CYP17A1), likely secondary to mitochondrial NADPH imbalance.

## - 2. Hepatic / Renal
- **ALT 46 U/L** → mild hepatic strain, possibly from oxidative load (TRT, mitochondrial inefficiency).  
- **AST normal** → no necrotic injury.  
- **Bilirubin, albumin, eGFR normal** → intact hepatic synthesis and renal clearance.

**Interpretation:**  
Supports *metabolic rather than structural* liver stress; reversible with improved redox control and insulin sensitivity.

---

## - 3. Lipid Panel
- LDL-C 106, HDL 48, TG 112 → moderate-normal lipids with insulin-resistant pattern (LDL slightly high, TG near normal).  
- When combined with fasting glucose pattern → suggests selective hepatic insulin resistance (VLDL production active, peripheral insulin sensitivity preserved).

---

## - 4. Hematologic
- Platelets 143 K/µL → borderline low; may reflect catecholamine stress or marrow suppression secondary to cortisol.  
- Hemoglobin and indices normal.  
- Consistent with transient redistribution rather than pathology.

---

## - 5. Inflammatory / Nutritional
- hs-CRP 1.1 mg/L → minimal systemic inflammation.  
- Ferritin 82 ng/mL → adequate stores, no anemia of chronic disease.  
- B12/Folate normal → methylation support adequate.

---

## - 6. Thyroid
- TSH 2.4 with normal FT3/FT4 → euthyroid.  
- Reverse T3 19 → mild adaptive upregulation, expected under fasting stress.  
- No evidence of primary hypothyroidism.

---

## - 7. Integrated Mechanistic Summary
- Pattern = **HPA-driven, hepatic-selective insulin resistance with suppressed mitochondrial ketogenesis.**
- **Cortisol > DHEA-S** ratio remains high → consistent with chronic sympathetic activation.
- **TRT + aromatase control** improving androgen stability but does not fully restore DHEA or mitochondrial coupling.
- **Metformin** previously ineffective due to redox burden; **tirzepatide** directly targets glucagon suppression and hepatic insulin signaling.

---

## - 8. Clinical Correlation & Next Steps
- Reinforces tirzepatide renewal rationale (GLP-1/GIP support of hepatic insulin signaling).  
- Suggests monitoring **AST/ALT**, **DHEA-S**, and **β-hydroxybutyrate** with each therapy change.  
- Recommend exploring **mitochondrial redox cofactors** (R-lipoate, carnitine, NAD+ precursors).  
- Consider early-morning cortisol-DHEA ratio trend to gauge HPA recalibration.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Findings are consistent with metabolic inflexibility secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction and HPA overactivity, improving under incretin therapy.  
Data integration will be added to `data/labs_trend.csv` for longitudinal modeling.
