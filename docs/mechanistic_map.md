# Mechanistic Map — Stress-Event Modulation

| System | Overactivation Pathway | Corrective Agents | Mechanism of Restoration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HPA Axis (cortisol/sympathetic)** | Excess catecholamines → hypertension, tremor, anxiety | Clonidine, Hydroxyzine, CBD, Quetiapine | ↓NE release, ↑parasympathetic tone |
| **Histamine Axis** | Mast-cell activation → insomnia, irritability | DAO, Famotidine, Hydroxyzine | H1/H2 blockade, enzymatic degradation |
| **Metabolic Axis** | Cortisol-driven gluconeogenesis → high fasting glucose | Testosterone, SAMe, Probiotics | Improves insulin signaling, lowers stress glucose |
| **Energy Axis (CNS/muscle)** | Mitochondrial depletion → fatigue, fog | Creatine, HMB, Testosterone, B-Complex | Restores ATP and methylation cofactor balance |
| **Neurotransmitter Balance** | Monoamine depletion → depression, panic | SAMe, Testosterone, CBD | Restores methylation & dopaminergic tone |

| **Histamine–Folate Sensitivity** | High-histamine foods or excess folate → histamine surge / methylation shift | DAO, Famotidine, Hydroxyzine; cautious folate strategy; Clonidine (for adrenergic amplification) | Lowers histamine signaling/absorptive load; calms sympathetic co-activation; supports sleep |

| **Creatine / Methylation Burden Relief** | Supplementing creatine spares ~50 % of SAMe usage otherwise devoted to endogenous synthesis; enhances histamine inactivation (HNMT) | Creatine 3–5 g daily (maintenance) | Lowers MCAS flare frequency/intensity via reduced methylation strain and improved histamine clearance |
