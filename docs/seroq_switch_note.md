# Seroquel (Quetiapine) → Ketosis Transition Note

**Observation:** During supervised 72-hour fast, ketosis (↑β-hydroxybutyrate) began only after quetiapine was administered near the end of the fast.

**Interpretation:** Sedative/anti-adrenergic effect likely reduced sympathetic drive/HPA arousal that had been blocking lipolysis/ketogenesis → supports central (hypothalamic/HPA/autonomic) mechanism for impaired metabolic switching.
